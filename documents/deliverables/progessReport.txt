
Julian's plan:

Week 04/13 to 04/20
Started reading about SWT in web tutorials and documentation in order to decide 
if it was a good idea to implement the GUI with SWT. 

Next week:
Saturday 21: Create a simple GUI for Pawned using SWT. If it is not that 
difficult to learn, then use SWT to start implementing the whole GUI.
Write tests for Piece, Board, RectangularBoard, Action.

Sunday 22: Continue writing tests, and continue work with the GUI.

Monday 23: Finish a preliminary version of the GUI, with the basic functionality.


Week 04/20 to 04/27
Implemented GraphicUI, almost all basic functionality (File Menu, with new game 
window, load game window, save game window, and quit window). All data from the 
new game and load windows is send to the methods initializeGame() and 
initializeSavedGame(), respectively. Piece movement in the board is also
implemented. There is a method for drawing pieces anywhere in the board. The
method setUpBoardForMove takes a list of valid moves, and constrains what the
user can click and change in the board. Also, when the user puts the mouse over
a piece that can move, the possible end cells are highlighted.
To see an example of this working, select "Pawn Someone" in the Pawn menu. You 
can see in the board the possible moves of a pawn, knight, and bishop. After
making a move, the move is displayed in the console. The "Pawn someone" option
allows you to make only one move. "Pawn someone" can be clicked again to restart
the example. The code that makes this example starts around line 247.

For next week:
Saturday: (? - not sure if we need to have that for Tuesday)
	make the timers in the GUI 
	display captured pieces? 
	display move history?
	help with the other parts of the program
Sunday: 
	help with the other parts of the program
	start integrating game to the GUI
Monday:
	everything for the preliminary release has to be almost done
