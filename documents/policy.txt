Policy for Final Project

CVS:

- Never commit code that will not compile or not work
- Always leave a comment explaining what you are committing
- Perform regression tests after every time you commit to check if your codes
breaks some previously existing code.

Code:

- Do not write sucky code
- Always comment any assumptions made, and make nice specs (improve them too)

General:

- Since Eclipse has no "word wrap", to make our files print without lines being
broken, never write characters past position 81 in any given line.
